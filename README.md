# StackViz

A Visual Studio Code extension that provides real-time visualization of function call stacks. StackViz generates interactive tree visualizations of function executions, making it easier to understand program flow, debug complex call chains, and teach programming concepts.

## Features

- Real-time visualization of function call stacks
- Interactive tree diagram showing function calls and their relationships
- Parameter and return value tracking for each function call
- Support for multiple programming languages
- Customizable visualization themes
- Perfect for understanding:
  - Function call hierarchies
  - Recursive functions and algorithms
  - Program execution flow
  - Complex debugging scenarios
  - Dynamic programming patterns
  - Callback chains

## Installation

1. Open Visual Studio Code
2. Go to the Extensions view (`Ctrl+Shift+X` or `Cmd+Shift+X`)
3. Search for "StackViz"
4. Click Install

## Usage

1. Open your project file
2. Place breakpoints in functions you want to visualize
3. Start debugging your code
4. The StackViz panel will automatically appear on the right side
5. Watch the call stack tree update in real-time as functions are called and return
